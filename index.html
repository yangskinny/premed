            <p class="font-passenger text-lg">A lot of third-party resources here, including Altius FLs and Blueprint content books. It also has some old pre-2015 AAMC practice exams, which is good for additional AAMC CARS practice.</p>

            <p class="font-passenger text-lg">I adore John and Maggie, bless their souls. And maybe you will have a newfound appreciation of their humour and explanations after watching the videos from the highly advertised High Yield Course. This includes all the videos, their corresponding practise problems, Anki deck, and book PDF.</p>

            <p class="font-passenger text-lg">Most recent update of the deck is 19 September 2024, so it'll have Miledown and MrPankow and whatever else it's supposed to have.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl pt-6 font-neutronic text-teal-600 hover:text-teal-800">Memm Anki Deck</h2>
            <p class="font-passenger text-lg">Memm is Kevin Jubbal's (aka MedSchoolInsiders) Anki/Quizlet clone. I turned all the flashcards from this website into an Anki deck because let's face it: Memm still falls short of Anki. There's no dark mode, it's limited in customization, you can't mass suspend cards, and the new algorithm he advertises is BS. Anki also has the new FSRS, so there's really no need to shell out on Memm's supposed superior algorithm. However, credit where credit is due, I do actually think the cards are pretty well-written. So check it out. Maybe use it to supplement your content review. Everything is tagged, and I even tagged all the equations. I included an "Extra" section in the behavioral sciences which contains the new AnkingxPankow PS cards, as well as some of my own while reviewing UWorld. Memm's Behavioral Sciences cards were supposedly made using the 300-page doc, but there were a lot of things they excluded, that the AnkingxPankow cards will cover. And you'll hear people complaining how Pankow still doesn't cover everything. Well, hopefully the UWorld stuff I've added will address the gaps.</p>

            <p class="font-passenger text-lg">I am pretty sure I got this for free in one of those annual member-exclusive Audible sales many, many years ago (I am a daily Audible user because I love audiobooks). Anyways, when I studied, I only used this resource like, for 2 weeks then abandoned it. And it wasn't even a good use - I was driving while listening. Anyways, I digress. I used InAudible to kill Audible's DRM, and am now sharing the wealth. The zip will have all the audio files and the PDF. Listen to it when you workout or drive or something, and please let me know how it goes.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl pt-6 font-neutronic text-teal-600 hover:text-teal-800">Sketchy MCAT Anki Deck</h2>
          <p class="font-passenger text-lg">Yes, I am aware Sketchy has officially released a whole MCAT deck. But they still suck because the videos are untagged and don't have the images to go with the sketch. Their principle is that they'll just link the video and if you want the cue, just rewatch the video. But then again, I embarked on making this deck way before they started their decks, but sadly, I am not going to finish this deck since I just don't have the time. But I'll share what I have. The Physics portion is 100% complete, everything else is sprinkled here and there. I hope you like my deck better though. I also think there's an updated official Sketchy deck on r/AnkiMCAT that is tagged.</p>

          <p class="font-passenger text-lg">This is probably the best formula sheet I've seen. I think it's missing the catalytic efficency and Kcat equations, and you know how important those are. But everything else on here is pretty legit, and I highly recommend writing out a formula sheet ahead of time, before a full length or real exam, and really try to match it with this one.</p>
